# Docker Security Best Practices

This document outlines security best practices implemented in this project and provides guidance for maintaining a secure Docker environment.

## Container Security

### Image Security

- **Use Official Base Images**: All services use official images from trusted sources (Python, Node.js, Nginx, MongoDB, Redis).
- **Multi-stage Builds**: Implemented to reduce attack surface and image size.
- **Minimal Base Images**: Using Alpine Linux variants where possible to minimize vulnerabilities.
- **Regular Updates**: Base images should be regularly updated to include security patches.
- **No Unnecessary Packages**: Only required packages are installed.

### Image Scanning

- **Automated Vulnerability Scanning**: Trivy is integrated into the CI pipeline to scan for vulnerabilities.
- **Policy Enforcement**: Images with critical or high vulnerabilities are blocked from deployment.
- **Regularly Scheduled Scans**: Implement periodic scanning of deployed images.

## Runtime Security

### Container Configuration

- **Non-root Users**: Services run as non-root users where possible.
- **Read-only Filesystem**: Container filesystems are mounted read-only where appropriate.
- **Limited Capabilities**: Containers run with minimal Linux capabilities.
- **Resource Limits**: CPU and memory limits are defined to prevent resource exhaustion attacks.
- **Healthchecks**: All containers have healthchecks to ensure they're operating correctly.

### Network Security

- **Network Segmentation**: Services are isolated in their own network.
- **Minimal Exposed Ports**: Only necessary ports are exposed.
- **Rate Limiting**: Implemented in Nginx to prevent DDoS attacks.
- **TLS Termination**: HTTPS configuration ready for production.

## Access Control & Secrets Management

### Secret Management

- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive data is passed via environment variables, not hardcoded.
- **No Secrets in Images**: No sensitive data is stored in Docker images.
- **Docker Secrets**: For Swarm deployments, use Docker Secrets.
- **External Secret Stores**: Consider integrating HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager for production.

### Access Control

- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Containers access only resources they need.
- **Network Policy**: Inter-service communication is restricted to necessary paths.
- **API Authentication**: Services authenticate with each other.

## Infrastructure Security

### Host Security

- **Host Hardening**: Keep Docker host OS updated and follow security best practices.
- **Docker Daemon Security**: Configure Docker daemon with TLS authentication.
- **Audit Logging**: Enable Docker daemon audit logging in production.
- **Resource Isolation**: Use cgroups and namespaces for container isolation.

### CI/CD Security

- **Pipeline Security**: CI/CD pipelines run with minimal permissions.
- **Image Signing**: Consider implementing Docker Content Trust for image signing.
- **Immutable Deployments**: Each deployment creates new containers rather than updating existing ones.

## Monitoring & Logging

### Security Monitoring

- **Centralized Logging**: All container logs are collected in a central location.
- **Log Analysis**: Implement log analysis for security events.
- **Prometheus Alerts**: Set up security-related alerts in Prometheus.
- **Container Monitoring**: Monitor container behavior for anomalies.

### Incident Response

- **Container Isolation**: Procedures to isolate compromised containers.
- **Forensics**: Capability to capture container filesystem for analysis.
- **Rollback Plan**: Process to quickly rollback to previous secure versions.

## Compliance Considerations

- **Image Registry Compliance**: Ensure image registry meets compliance requirements.
- **Audit Trail**: Maintain records of deployments and changes.
- **Policy Enforcement**: Implement policies preventing deployment of insecure images.
- **Regular Security Assessments**: Schedule regular security reviews of Docker environment.
